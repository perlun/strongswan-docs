== Plugins

=== New Plugins

The following new `*libstrongswan*` plugins have been *added*:

[cols="5,22"]
|===
|Plugin Name |Description

|frodo
|FrodoKEM post quantum safe key exchange method

|oqs
|Open quantum safe plugin based on the {LIBOQS}[`*liboqs*`] library
|===

=== Removed Plugins

The following deprecated `*libstrongswan*` plugins have been *removed*:

[cols="5,22"]
|===
|Plugin Name |Description

|bliss
|Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) post-quantum computer signature scheme

|newhope
|Key exchange based on post-quantum computer New Hope algorithm

|ntru
|Key exchange based on post-quantum computer NTRU encryption
|===

=== Default Plugins

The powerful `*openssl*` crypto plugin is now *enabled* by default:

[cols="5,22"]
|===
|Plugin Name |Description

|openssl
|Crypto backend based on the {OPENSSL}[OpenSSL] library
|===

Due to the nearly all-encompassing capabilities of the `*openssl*` default
crypto plugin, the following `*libstrongswan*` plugins are *not enabled* by
default anymore:

[cols="5,22"]
|===
|Plugin Name |Description

|aes
|AES-128/192/256 cipher software implementation

|curve25519
|X25519 DH group and Ed25519 public key authentication

|des
|DES/3DES cipher software implementation

|fips-prf
|PRF specified by FIPS, used by EAP-SIM/AKA algorithms

|gmp
|RSA/DH crypto backend based on {GMP}[libgmp]

|hmac
|HMAC wrapper using various hashers

|md5
|MD5 hasher software implementation

|pkcs12
|PKCS#12 decoding routines

|rc2
|RC2 cipher software implementation

|sha1
|SHA1 hasher software implementation

|sha2
|SHA-2 hasher software implementation
|===

IMPORTANT: The legacy `*stroke*` management interface has been deprecated for many
           years and has been replaced by the versatile xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`]
           management interface. Thus with strongSwan 6.0, the `*stroke*` plugin
           is *not enabled* by default anymore and has to be built separately.

[cols="5,22"]
|===
|Plugin Name |Description

|stroke
|Deprecated stroke configuration/control backend used with ipsec script and starter
|===

Thus the xref:/plugins/plugins.adoc#_default_plugins[following 25 plugins] are now
enabled by xref:/plugins/plugins.adoc#_default_plugins[default].

== Configuration Options

The following two xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon[`*strongswan.conf*`]
configuration options are now enabled by default:

[cols="4,1,8"]
|===
|*Key*|*Default*|*Description [Default]*

|make_before_break                           |`yes`
|Initiate IKEv2 reauthentication with a *make-before-break* instead of a
 *break-before-make* scheme. Make-before-break uses overlapping `IKE` and `CHILD SA`
 during reauthentication by first recreating all new SAs before deleting the old
 ones. This behavior can be beneficial to avoid connectivity gaps during
 reauthentication, but requires support for overlapping SAs by the peer.
 strongSwan can handle such overlapping SAs since version 5.3.0

|rsa_pss                                     |`yes`
|Use RSA with PSS padding by default. Revert to legacy PKCS#1 padding by setting
 the option to no
|===

Thus the following xref:pki/pki.adoc[`*pki*`] subcommands now use RSA-PSS signatures
per default:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|xref:pki/pkiAcert.adoc[`pki --acert`]
|xref:pki/pkiIssue.adoc[`pki --issue`]
|xref:pki/pkiSelf.adoc[`pki --self`]

|xref:pki/pkiReq.adoc[`pki --req`]
|xref:pki/pkiScep.adoc[`pki --scep`]
|xref:pki/pkiSignCrl.adoc[`pki --signcrl`]
|===

Use the command line option `*--rsa-padding pkcs1*` for legacy PKCS#1 padding.
