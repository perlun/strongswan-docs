NOTE: This page documents the configuration options of the most current release.
       Therefore, you should always consult the *strongswan.conf(5)* man page
       that comes with the release you are using to confirm which options are
       actually available.

== Overview

While the xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] and the legacy
`*ipsec.conf*` configuration files are well suited to define IPsec-related
configuration parameters, it is not useful for other strongSwan applications to
read options from these files. As the number of components of the strongSwan
project is continually growing, we needed a more flexible configuration file that
is easy to extend and can be used by all components.

The default `*strongswan.conf*` file is installed under `*$\{sysconfdir}*`, i.e.
the path usually  is `*/etc/strongswan.conf*`.

Since version 5.1.2 the default config file may be split up and separate files
are placed in the xref:config/strongswanDir.adoc[`*$\{sysconfdir}/strongswan.d*`]
directory.

The location in which `*strongswan.conf*` is looked for can be overwritten at
start time of the process using libstrongswan by setting the `*STRONGSWAN_CONF*`
environmental variable to the desired location.

== Reloading

The IKE xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon and some of its derivatives
reloads `*strongswan.conf*` if it receives a `*SIGHUP*` signal (that has to be
sent manually to the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon) or can be
triggered via either the xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] `*reload-settings*` or
the xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl*`] `*--reload-settings*` commands.

This reloads the xref:config/logging.adoc[logger settings] and some plugins
also support reloading their configuration (e.g. the
xref:plugins/attr.adoc[*`attr*`], the xref:plugins/pkcs11.adoc[`*pkcs11*`] or the
xref:plugins/eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] plugins) and many settings are always
read directly from the latest config (some at least for new connections).

== Syntax

The format consists of hierarchical `*sections*` and a list of `*key/value*` pairs
in each `*section*`.

Each section has a name, followed by C-style curly brackets defining the section
body. Each section body contains a set of `*subsections*` and `*key/value*` pairs:
----
settings := (section|keyvalue)*
section  := name { settings }
keyvalue := key = value\n
----

Values must be terminated by a newline. Comments are possible using the
`*&num;*` character. Section names and keys may contain any printable character except:
----
. , : { } = " # \n \t space
----

An example might look like this:
----
a = b
section-one {
  somevalue = asdf
  subsection {
    othervalue = xxx
  }
  # yei, a comment
  yetanother = zz
}
section-two {
  x = 12
}
----

Indentation is optional. You may use tabs or spaces.

=== Referencing other Sections

Since version 5.7.0 it is possible to inherit settings and sections from another
section. This feature is mainly useful in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] which uses the same configuration
file format.

The syntax for references is as follows:
----
section    := name : references { settings }
references := absname[, absname]*
absname    := name[.name]*
----

All `*key/value*` pairs and all `*subsections*` of the referenced sections will
be inherited by the section that references them via their absolute name. Values
may be overridden in the section or any of its sub-sections (use an empty
assignment to clear a value so its default value, if any, will apply). It is
currently not possible to limit the inclusion level or clear/remove inherited
`*subsections*`.

If the order is important (e.g. for auth rounds in a connection, if `*round*` is
not used), it should be noted that inherited settings/sections will follow those
defined in the current section (if multiple sections are referenced, their
settings are enumerated left to right).

References are evaluated dynamically at runtime, so referring to sections later
in the config file or included via other files is no problem.

Here is an example of how this might look like in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]:
----
conn-defaults {
  # default settings for all conns (e.g. a cert, or IP pools)
}
eap-defaults {
  # defaults if eap is used (e.g. a remote auth round)
}
child-defaults {
  # defaults for child configs (e.g. traffic selectors)
}
connections {
  conn-a : conn-defaults, eap-defaults {
    # set/override stuff specific to this connection
    children {
      child-a : child-defaults {
        # set/override stuff specific to this child
      }
    }
  }
  conn-b : conn-defaults {
    # set/override stuff specific to this connection
    children {
      child-b : child-defaults {
        # set/override stuff specific to this child
      }
    }
  }
  conn-c : connections.conn-a {
    # everything is inherited, including everything conn-a
    # already inherits from the sections it and its
    # sub-section reference
  }
}
----

=== Including Files

The `*include*` statement allows to include other files into `*strongswan.conf*`,
e.g.
----
include /some/path/*.conf
----
If the file name is not an absolute path, it is considered to be relative to the
directory of the file containing the include statement. The file name may include
shell wildcards. Also, such inclusions can be nested.

Sections loaded from the included files *extend* previously loaded sections; already
existing values are *replaced*. It is important to note that settings are added
relative to the section the include statement is in.

As an example, the following three files result in the same final config as the
one given above:
----
a = b
section-one {
  somevalue = before include
  include include.conf
}
include other.conf
----
File `include.conf`:
----
# settings loaded from this file are added to section-one
# the following replaces the previous value
somevalue = asdf
subsection {
  othervalue = yyy
}
yetanother = zz
----
File `other.conf`:
----
# this extends section-one and subsection
section-one {
  subsection {
    # this replaces the previous value
    othervalue = xxx
  }
}
section-two {
  x = 12
}
----

== Reading values

The config file is read by libstrongswan during library initialization (or when
a reload is triggered). Values are accessed using a dot-separated section list
and a key: Accessing `*section-one.subsection.othervalue*` in the examples above
will return `*xxx*`.

Have a look at the settings interface {GITHUB}/{SETTINGS}[`{SETTINGS}`]
to learn about the details.

(e.g. `*charon-systemd*` instead of `*charon*`).

[{COLS}]
|===
|*Key*|*Default*|*Description [Default]*

|accept_private_algs                         |`no`
|Deliberately violate the IKE standard's requirement and allow the use of private
algorithm identifiers, even if the peer implementation is unknown (i.e. if the
peer doesn't send a vendor ID via `*send_vendor_id*`)

|block_threshold                             |`5`
|Maximum number of half-open IKE_SAs (including unprocessed IKE_SA_INITs) for a
 single peer IP

|cache_crls                                  |`no`
|Whether Certicate Revocation Lists (CRLs) fetched via HTTP or LDAP should be
 saved under a unique file name derived from the public key of the Certification
 Authority (CA) to xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*$\{sysconfdir}/x509crl*`]

|check_current_path                          |`no`
|By default, after detecting any changes to interfaces and/or addresses no action
 is taken if the current path to the remote peer still looks usable. Enabling
 this option will use DPD to check if the path actually still works, or, for
 instance, the peer removed the state after a longer phase without connectivity.
 It will also trigger a MOBIKE update if NAT mappings were removed during the
 downtime

|cert_cache                                  |`yes`
|Whether relations in validated certificate chains should be cached in memory

|cisco_flexvpn                               |`no`
|Send the Cisco FlexVPN vendor ID payload (IKEv2 only), which is required in order
 to make Cisco brand devices allow negotiating a local traffic selector (from
 strongSwan's point of view) that is not the assigned virtual IP address if such
 an address is requested by strongSwan. Sending the Cisco FlexVPN vendor ID
 prevents the peer from narrowing the initiator's local traffic selector and
 allows it to e.g. negotiate a TS of `*0.0.0.0/0 == 0.0.0.0/0*` instead.  This
 has been tested with a "tunnel mode ipsec ipv4" Cisco template but should also
 work for GRE encapsulation

|cisco_unity                                 |`no`
|Send Cisco Unity vendor ID payload (IKEv1 only),
 see xref:plugins/unity.adoc[`*unity*`] plugin

|close_ike_on_child_failure                  |`no`
|Close the `IKE SA` if setup of the `CHILD SA` along with IKE_AUTH failed

|cookie_threshold                            |`30`
|Number of half-open IKE_SAs (including unprocessed IKE_SA_INITs) that activate
 the cookie mechanism

|cookie_threshold_ip                         |`3`
|Number of half-open IKE_SAs (including unprocessed IKE_SA_INITs) for a single
 peer IP that activate the cookie mechanism (since version 5.9.6)

|crypto_test                                 |
|Section to configure crypto tests, see <<_charon_crypto_test>>

|delete_rekeyed                              |`no`
|Delete CHILD_SAs right after they got successfully rekeyed (IKEv1 only). Reduces
 the number of stale CHILD_SAs in scenarios with a lot of rekeyings. However this
 might cause problems with implementations that continue to use rekeyed SAs until
 they expire

|delete_rekeyed_delay                        |`5`
|Delay in seconds until inbound IPsec SAs are deleted after rekeyings (IKEv2 only).
 To process delayed packets the inbound part of a CHILD_SA is kept installed up
 to the configured number of seconds after it got replaced during a rekeying. If
 set to `*0*` the CHILD_SA will be kept installed until it expires. If no
 lifetime is set it will be destroyed immediately

|dh_exponent_ansi_x9_42                      |`yes`
|Use ANSI X9.42 DH exponent size or optimum size matched to cryptographical
 strength

|dlopen_use_rtld_now                         |`no`
|Use RTLD_NOW with dlopen() when loading plugins and IMV/IMCs to reveal missing
 symbols immediately. Useful during development of custom plugins

|dns1                                        |
|DNS server assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP), see
 xref:plugins/attr.adoc[`*attr*`] plugin

|dns2                                        |
|DNS server assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP)

|dos_protection                              |`yes`
|Enable Denial of Service protection using cookies and aggressiveness checks

|filelog                                     |
|Section to define file loggers, see
xref:config/logging.adoc[logger configuration]

|flush_auth_cfg                              |`no`
|If enabled objects used during authentication (certificates, identities etc.)
 are released to free memory once an IKE_SA is established. Enabling this might
 conflict with plugins that later need access to e.g. the used certificates

|follow_redirects                            |`yes`
|Whether to follow IKEv2 redirects, see {RFC5685}[RFC 5685]

|force_eap_only_authentication               |`no`
|Violate  the *EAP-only* authentication requirements according to
 {RFC5998}[RFC 5998], even if the peer did not send an `EAP_ONLY_AUTHENTICATION`
 notify during `IKE_AUTH`

|fragment_size                               |`1280`
|Maximum size (complete IP datagram size in bytes) of a sent IKE fragment when
 using proprietary IKEv1 or standardized IKEv2 fragmentation. If specified, this
 limit is used for both IPv4 and IPv6 with a default of `*1280*` bytes. Use `*0*`
 for the address-family-specific default values defined by
 {RFC7383}#section-2.5.1[RFC 7383] which specifies a very conservative limit of
 `*576*` bytes for IPv4 but sets the limit to `*1280*` bytes for IPv6.

|group                                       |
|Name of the xref:install/reducedPrivileges.adoc[group] the daemon changes
 to after startup

|half_open_timeout                           |`30`
|Timeout in seconds for connecting IKE_SAs, also see
 xref:config/jobPriority.adoc#_ike_sa_init_dropping[IKE_SA_INIT dropping]

|hash_and_url                                |`no`
|Enable hash and URL support

|host_resolver.max_threads                   |`3`
|Maximum number of concurrent resolver threads (they are terminated if unused)

|host_resolver.min_threads                   |`0`
|Minimum number of resolver threads to keep around

|ignore_acquire_ts                           |`no`
|If this is disabled the traffic selectors from the kernel's acquire events,
 which are derived from the triggering packet, are prepended to the traffic
 selectors from the configuration for IKEv2 connection. By enabling this, such
 specific traffic selectors will be ignored and only the ones in the config will
 be sent. This always happens for IKEv1 connections as the protocol only supports
 one set of traffic selectors per `CHILD SA`

|ignore_routing_tables                       |
|A space-separated list of routing tables to be excluded from route lookup

|ikesa_limit                                 |`0`
|Maximum number of IKE_SAs that can be established at the same time before new
connection attempts are blocked

|ikesa_table_segments                        |`1`
|Number of exclusively locked segments in the hash table, see
 xref:config/lookupTuning.adoc[IKE_SA lookup tuning]

|ikesa_table_size                            |`1`
|Size of the `IKE SA` hash table, see

|Whether to close IKE_SA if the only `CHILD SA` closed due to inactivity

|init_limit_half_open                        |`0`
|Limit new connections based on the current number of half open IKE_SAs, see
 xref:config/jobPriority.adoc#_ike_sa_init_dropping[IKE_SA_INIT dropping]

|init_limit_job_load                         |`0`
|Limit new connections based on the number of jobs currently queued for processing,
 see xref:config/jobPriority.adoc#_ike_sa_init_dropping[IKE_SA_INIT dropping]

|initiator_only                              |`no`
|Causes charon daemon to ignore IKE initiation requests

|install_routes                              |`yes`
|Install routes into a separate routing table for established IPsec tunnels.
 If disabled a more efficient lookup for source and next-hop addresses is used.
 Since version 5.5.2

|install_virtual_ip                          |`yes`
|Install xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses

|install_virtual_ip_on                       |
|The name of the interface on which xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses
 should be installed. If not specified the addresses will be installed on the
 outbound interface

|integrity_test                              |`no`
|Check xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon, `*libcharon*`, `*libstrongswan*`
 and other strongSwan libraries as well as and plugin integrity at startup

|interfaces_ignore                           |
|A comma-separated list of network interfaces that should be ignored by the
 xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon. If `*interfaces_use*` is specified,
 this option has no effect

|interfaces_use                              |
|A comma-separated list of network interfaces that should be used by the
 xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon. All other interfaces are ignored

|keep_alive                                  |`20s`
|NAT keep alive interval in seconds

|keep_alive_dpd_margin                       |`0s`
|Number of seconds the keep alive interval may be exceeded before a DPD is sent
 instead of a NAT keep alive (`*0*` to disable).  This is only useful if a clock
 is used that includes time spent suspended (e.g. `*CLOCK_BOOTTIME*`)

|Plugins to load in IKEv2 charon daemon, see
 xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc[Plugin Load]

|load_modular                                |`no`
|If enabled the list of plugins to load is determined by individual `*load*`
 settings for each plugin, see
 xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc#_modular_configuration[Modular Configuration]

|make_before_break                           |`yes`
|Initiate IKEv2 reauthentication with a *make-before-break* instead of a
 *break-before-make* scheme. Make-before-break uses overlapping `IKE` and `CHILD SA`
 during reauthentication by first recreating all new SAs before deleting the old
 ones. This behavior can be beneficial to avoid connectivity gaps during
 reauthentication, but requires support for overlapping SAs by the peer.
 strongSwan can handle such overlapping SAs since version 5.3.0

|max_ikev1_exchanges                         |`3`
|Maximum number of IKEv1 phase 2 exchanges per IKE_SA to keep state about and
 track concurrently

|ocsp_nonce_len                              |`32`
|Length of nonces in OCSP requests. According to {RFC8954}[RFC 8954], valid
 values are between 1 and 32, with new clients required to use 32. Some servers
 might not support that so lowering the value to e.g. 16 might be necessary.
 Since version 5.9.13

|port                                        |`500`
|UDP port used locally. If set to 0 a random port will be allocated

|port_nat_t                                  |`4500`
|UDP port used locally in case of NAT-T. If set to 0 a random port will be
 allocated. Has to be different from `*port*`, otherwise a random port will be
 allocated

|prefer_best_path                            |`no`
|By default, charon keeps SAs on the routing path with addresses it previously
 used if that path is still usable. By enabling this option, it tries more
 aggressively to update SAs with MOBIKE on routing priority changes using the
 cheapest path. This adds more noise, but allows to dynamically adapt SAs to
 routing priority changes. This option has no effect if MOBIKE is not supported
 or disabled

|prefer_configured_proposals                 |`yes`
|Prefer locally configured proposals for IKE/IPsec over supplied ones as responder
 (disabling this can avoid keying retries due to `INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD` notifies)

|prefer_temporary_addrs                      |`no`
|By default public IPv6 addresses are preferred over temporary ones according
 to {RFC4941}[RFC 4941] to make connections more stable. Enable this option to
 reverse this.

|process_route                               |`yes`
|Process `RTM_NEWROUTE` and `RTM_DELROUTE` events

|Subsection to configure the number of reserved threads per priority class,
 see xref:config/jobPriority.adoc[Job Priority]

|reject_trusted_end_entity                   |`no`
|Reject peers that use trusted end-entity certificates (i.e. local certificates).
 Since version 5.9.12

|rdn_matching                                |[->]
|How the Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs) a certificate's Subject Distinguished
 Name (DN) is composed of, are matched against configured identities. Possible
 values are `*strict*` (the default), `*reordered*`, and `*relaxed*`.  With
 `*strict*` the number, type and order of all RDNs have to match. Wildcards (`*&ast;*`)
 for RDN values are allowed (that's the case for all three variants). Using
 `*reordered*` also matches a DN if the RDNs appear in a different order, The
 number and type still have to match. Finally `*relaxed*` also allows matches of
 DNs that contain more RDNs than the configured identity (missing RDNs are
 treated like a wildcard match). Note that `*reordered*` and `*relaxed*` impose a
 considerable overhead on memory usage and runtime, in particular for mismatches
 as compared to `*strict*`.
